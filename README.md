Introduction:

As a representative of DDS Analytics, I will focus my analysis on identifying varaibles a company can focus on to improve employee development and increase retention rates. Analyzing the frequencies of categorical variables and the medians of continuous variables for specific job titles we hope to identify key predictors that identify employees who are likely to remain and those who will leave/be fired. 

Summary:

We discovered that Overtime, Stock Option and Job Level had a strong correlation with predicting Attrition, and it was possible that those job position with turnover rates higher than the overall company could be due high levels of retirement.
